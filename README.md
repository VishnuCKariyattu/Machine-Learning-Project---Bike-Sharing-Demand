# Machine-Learning-Project---Bike-Sharing-Demand
Project to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

**Description**
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. The purpose of this project is to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

Evaluation
Submissions was evaluated on the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The RMSLE is calculated as

Where:

(n) is the number of hours in the test set
(pi) is your predicted count
(ai) is the actual count
(log(x)) is the natural logarithm
